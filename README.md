# ToDo App

Welcome to my first project using DOM manipulation in JavaScript! This simple ToDo app allows you to manage your tasks effectively. My primary goal with this project is to enhance my knowledge of JavaScript coding and improve my skills in working with the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Features

- Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark as Done: Mark tasks as done once you've completed them.
- Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from your list that you no longer need.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/mohsodais107/toDoApp.git


2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Start managing your tasks!

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the ToDo app.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for enhancing the visual appeal of the app.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file handling DOM manipulation and ToDo app logic.

## Project Goals

My main objectives with this project are:

- Gain hands-on experience with JavaScript.
- Understand how to manipulate the DOM to create interactive web applications.
- Learn and practice event handling for user interactions.
- Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use it as a reference for your own learning journey!

Happy coding!
